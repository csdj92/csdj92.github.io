Project week! Hearing our cohort lead tell us project week was coming up gave me knots in my stomach. I was having imposter syndrome. I was able to complete all of the labs up to the final project but still felt like I wasn't very knowledgeable on ruby. Before the start of project week I spent my weekend reviewing my previous labs and looking up different examples online. I was trying to put myself in the best possible spot mentally to start my project.

Monday comes and I start my project, my first choice was to scrape a horoscope API. I soon learned that things were going to be a lot harder than I originally thought. My first issue was retrieving the correct horoscope by day, week or month along with the users sign. I was able to use string interpolation to take user input and change the default url.
My issue became not being able to pull a second layer of data and after determining that it was already the end of day one.

Tuesday started and I knew I had to find a new API. After going through the video lecture again I used a resource mentioned  and went to the free api website where I chose the rick and morty api. Later in the day I had my first one on one and that really helped me get started. After I made a zoom class with a couple from the cohort and we all talked out our problems and helped troubleshoot which was really a big help. By the end of the day I was almost done with my project. I definitely learned a lot and was proud of what I was able to accomplish.
