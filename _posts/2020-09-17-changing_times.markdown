   Since the age of 18 I worked in the healthcare field. I am now 27 and decided it was time for a change. I realized it was time for a change at the beginning of 2020, as I went to my job as a dialysis technician I felt beat down and unappreciated. Then covid hit and that just made everything worse with ever changing policies and the looming fear of the virus of itself I decided it was time for a change. I have always been a tech guy for my family and friends so I figured I could take a look into something on the tech side of the career spectrum. Around this same time my younger sister was going to a tech camp in Cleveland and recommended I look into something similar. After hours of looking at reviews, comparing graduation results and talking to my fiance I decided this was something I wanted to do.
