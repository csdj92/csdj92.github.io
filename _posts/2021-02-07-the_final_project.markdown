The last 5 months have flown by to say the least. As a sit here and review my final project i'm reflecting on everything that has happened over the course of this class and what it has taught me about coding and about myself.

# Time Management 
One of the most important things I learned during this course is making sure you keep track of your due dates and life events. At the start of every new section I would go through to count how many lessons there were and how many days it would take to complete the section. I would always try to add a couple more lessons each day to get a head start on the project. This was very important to me because I wanted to be able to have time outside of class to enjoy my hobbies and give my brain a break.

Being able to manage my time efficiently allowed me to start every project at least three days early, not only did this take pressure off my shoulders when it came to project week but it helped me dive deeper into the project and attempt to add features that we didn't cover in the curriculum. 

# Burnout 
Even with managing my time I would still push myself to finish more lessons so I could have more time outside of class to decompress. This started to catch up with me when I added some outside stress "buying my first house". I started to feel burnt out and it caused me to fall behind in my work. I soon realized how important it was to take care of yourself and your mental well-being. 

# Take Care of Yourself 
Overall this course has been amazing and I know that even though it is over I will still be learning new concepts and getting a deeper understanding of coding everyday.
